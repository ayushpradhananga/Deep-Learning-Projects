Objective


Develop deep learning models for the detection and classification of different types of agricultural pests from image data.

Components


Data Visualization: Sample images from the dataset are visualized for better understanding.
Deep Learning Models: Two models with distinct architectures are developed for pest classification.
Performance Analysis: Comparison of the models' performance and discussion on potential improvements for real-world applications.
