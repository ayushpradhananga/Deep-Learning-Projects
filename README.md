Overview


This repository contains deep learning solutions developed for three distinct clients across various industries: real estate, agriculture, and weather forecasting. Each project in the repository uses Python, leveraging deep learning and machine learning techniques to address specific business challenges. Google Colab with GPU support is employed for efficient development and experimentation.

Project Structure


The repository is divided into three main directories, each corresponding to a specific task and client requirement:

Real Estate Analytics (Task 1)


Agricultural Pest Recognition (Task 2)


Weather Forecasting (Task 3)

General Guidelines


Data Pre-processing: Each project contains specific data pre-processing steps relevant to the task.

Model Building and Evaluation: Detailed documentation on model architecture, parameters, and evaluation metrics.

Experimental Results: Each project includes an experiment report summarizing the outcomes and potential business impacts.
